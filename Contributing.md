# Contributing to ZEngine

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue. 

## Rules

**ZEngine** is built upon 2 rules:

1. You cannot add code that will slow down the rendering process
2. You cannot add code that will make things complex to use

### Performance

ZEngine is a 3D rendering engine. So every piece of code has to be scrutinized to look for potential bottlenecks or slow downs. Ultimately the goal is to render more with less resources.

## Pull Request Process

1. Make sure to transmit that your modification

2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.

4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
